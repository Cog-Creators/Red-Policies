# Licensing org projects
## OVERVIEW
This policy outlines the licensing requirements for existing and future org projects, including org sponsored services
## GOALS
- List the allowed type of licenses for org projects and services
- Protect the org from legal repercussions due to the use of non-free software
## SPECIFICATIONS
Going forward all org projects must be licensed under an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses). Any existing project that doesn't respect these requirements shall be relicensed, if applicable.
## BREAKDOWN
#### Defining "Org projects"
- Any organization-owned repository
- Any repository transferred to the organization due to an outside collaboration ([Policy 9](0009.md))
- Any org sponsored service used by a org project, such as an API
- Any tool used by the org for, but not limited to, deployment and managing purposes
#### OSI approved license
- A suitable license must be picked from the official [list of OSI approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- The chosen license must be one that at minimum guarantees the freedoms to use, modify, and (re)distribute the Software
- For org-owned repositories (including those transferred to the org due to a collaboration) where the org is not the main copyright holder, the org's name must appear next to the primary copyright holder, e.g. "\<primary holder name\>, Cog Creators"
