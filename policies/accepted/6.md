# Disputes and Disagreements
## OVERVIEW
Upon a dispute or disagreement, a vote should be called between the active org members so that a final decision can be made on it.
## BREAKDOWN
**Note**: The following does not apply to the member recruiting, which is already outlined in [Policy 2](2.md)
- The dissenting members should state an alternative solution or work together to achieve a solution that all active org members are happy with.
- Should a solution not be able to be reached, a vote should be called.
  - In the event of a tie, the proposal will always fail to pass.
  - Only active org members are able to cast votes.
- Once a vote passes/fails, another vote shall not be called on the same proposal for at least 1 month.
  - The only exception to this is on a tie failure, where a new vote can take place after 7 days.
  
**Note**: When a disputed vote is called, the person calling it should make it clear that this vote is being called under [Policy 6](6.md). The cooldown above only applies for votes called under [Policy 6](6.md). This is to ensure informal votes donâ€™t trigger this policy and cooldown.

Generally speaking this policy can be called for any disagreement/dispute in the org, but here as some examples of when it can be called:
- An Implementation suggestion.
- A Breaking change.
- Disagreement on ideology.
- Disagreement on distribution.
- Disagreement with the progress.
