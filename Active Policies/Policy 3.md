# Core Devs
## OVERVIEW
Clarifying processes for core devs moving forward.
## GOALS
- Introduce a lead core dev role.
- Set out duties of core dev duties.
- Set out core dev recruitment.
## BREAKDOWN
### <ins>Assigning a lead core dev</ins>
Should a lead core dev become inactive, the active org members would have a vote to have an acting core dev take their place for the duration of the inactivity. If the core dev with most votes decides to not become an acting lead, then another vote would be triggered with them no longer considered in the eligible core devs pool.
Should the inactive lead core dev trigger the retired timescale outlined on [policy 2](Policy%202.md), the acting lead will be elevated to the lead role.

**Note**: if the lead dev is taking a break, they are eligible to partake in the vote for choosing the acting lead.

### <ins>Lead core dev duties</ins>
- Work with other team leads to manage the org.
- Work with other core devs to prioritize issues.
- Work with lead QA to prioritize testing and quality assurance of specific issues and pull request.
- Work with other active core devs to manage releases.

### <ins>Core dev duties</ins>
- Core devs will work to close open issues.
- Core devs will work to fix any issues reported.
- Core devs will work to implement new features.

### <ins>Minimum Core devs</ins>
- There should always be a minimum of 2 core devs, but we should make an effort to have at least 3.
- As part of this policy, [Kowlin](https://github.com/Kowlin) should officially become the lead core dev.
- As part of this policy, [Jack](https://github.com/jack1142) should be made into a core dev.
- [Kowlin](https://github.com/Kowlin) and [Jack](https://github.com/jack1142) should come up with some suggestions for a 3rd core dev, which should be voted in by active org members, if no current core devs wish to be active.
- All current [core devs](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/teams/core-developers) will have the chance to remain active as part of this policy if they voice the desire to do so, if no desire is voiced prior to the vote then they will be moved to the inactive team.
  - [Palm](https://github.com/palmtree5) expressed his desire to remain active.
