# Definitions and Clarifications
1. "org" refers to the [Github Cog-Creators organization](https://github.com/Cog-Creators).
2. "org member" refers to [users](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/people) in the Cog-Creators organization. New members shall only be inducted after an affirming vote by the active org members ([Policy 7](Active%20Policies/Policy%207.md)) or, if applicable, by the current lead of that member's new team in the event of a tie ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)).
3. "active" org members are org members who have not [retired](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/teams/retired-org-member) or been deemed [inactive](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/teams/inactive-org-members) ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)). Only active org members are eligible to vote.
4. "inactive" member is a designation that exists to limit access to sensitive org resources when a member should not reasonably have access to them. [Inactive members](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/teams/inactive-org-members) shall be reinstated upon their request ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)).
5. "retired" members are those who have been inactive for two months ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)). [Retired members](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/teams/retired-org-members) shall only be reinstated after an affirming vote by the active org members ([Policy 7](Active%20Policies/Policy%207.md)) or, if applicable, by the current lead of that member's former team in the event of a tie ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)).
6. The GitHub [user list](https://github.com/orgs/Cog-Creators/people) shall be used as the effective list of stakeholders in the Red project. Only team leads and org owners ([Policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)) shall have the authority to add or remove users from the org, or move them to inactive or retired status (With one exception being outlined in [policy 2](Active%20Policies/Policy%202.md)).
